endDate = '2010-01-31'
```

## Script

Multiply series by scalar value.

```script
let
    A = read_series('A', fromDate, toDate)
    B = read_series('B', fromDate, toDate)
in
    A * B
```

## Expected output

We expect the same number of elements with the same time stamps and converted values.

```expected
